# Hi üëã

My name is Denis. I might introduce myself as a designer, a frontend developer, or an engineer, but I mix all of this and find myself as a broad range self-guided open-source creator. I build dream interfaces, knowledge hubs and useful web apps. And have so much more to improve on! I'm deep into the modern frontend web development, and this page is home for all of the code I've been contributing to the global web community since 2012. Welcome! üåä

I've founded and continue development of a network of open source sociocultural projects today. Each project starts from a good idea and transparent goals, then I share them in a transparent and collaborative way to find the people who would also like to engage in these projects for the best of all. I've started creating open source social projects by myself, but there are numerous collaborations that showd as really viable for other people and communities. I would be glad to meet new engaged people along the way. 

- Participate in any of these projects development and realization.
- Support my projects with stars, mentions, blog posts, social media coverage, donations or any other resources you are willing to bring to the open-source technology for everyone.
- You have any kind of creative multimedia web-app projects where you see me fit. 
 
Let's make something! So the initiatives would flow as long as we enjoy making world better together! ‚ú®

## üõ∏ Ultramodern frontend dev stack

I'm trying to maintain a good balance of making profitable commercial projects along with sharing open source knowledge hubs and services for everyone to use and build upon. I know that crowds of people would pass by before we meet with those of you, who can appreciate the work and have a feeling to go into some collaborative project including me. But take the risk and know that we'll gradually find each other, meet and grow into an international community of exceptional geeks reimagining the world with open-source projects. Ready to make your first project today? Ideas? Questions? Contact me when it's time for something new. ‚úåÔ∏è
